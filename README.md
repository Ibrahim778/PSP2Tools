# PSP2Tools

A unity package to streamline development for the PlayStation Vita

Supports building and installing your projects in one click.

(The rest of the readme will come someday, most is just self explanatory)
VitaFTPI but better.

Keep in mind, while this tool has been tested, since this toolkit runs in the unity editor instead of a standalone program you should properly save your work before running install operations to ensure the loss of work if any freezes decide to make themselves apparent. (Sometimes it might randomly freeze due to bad network)
